Cross-Platform Unique Machine Fingerprint

IMPORTANT NOTE: This library is presently incomplete, this is not for general use.

This project is based on the unique machine fingerprint code discussed in this article: https://oroboro.com/unique-machine-fingerprint/

If you're looking for a GPL V3 licensed version, this project here appears to be based off of the same code as the above article: https://github.com/Tarik02/machineid

However, I'm re-creating this based on the article to utilize the freedom of the MIT license.
